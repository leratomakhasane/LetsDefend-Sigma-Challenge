# LetsDefend-Sigma-Challenge
Detection engineering practice: Write-up and analysis of a LetsDefend challenge using a Sigma rule to detect ransomware activity leveraging bitsadmin.exe.
<br>
<br>
## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Detect and analyze a ransomware infection that leveraged the Windows utility bitsadmin.exe to download additional malicious payloads, using a Sigma detection rule.
<br>
## ðŸ§  Skills Learned

- Understanding Sigma rules and their structure (selection, condition, tags, fields, log sources)

- Investigating ransomware behaviour with built-in Windows utilities

- Correlating malicious activity with command-and-control (C2) communication patterns

- Applying detection engineering concepts in a real-world SOC scenario
<br>

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- LetsDefend Platform (challenge environment)

- Sigma Rules (YAML format)

- Windows Event Logs (proc_creation events)

- Text Editor (to review .yml rule file)

<br>

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed

1. Reviewed the challenge description: ransomware suspected of using bitsadmin.exe.
   ![The LetsDefend Challenge page explaining what the challenge is about](images/sigma-challenge-description.png "LetsDefend Learn Sigma Challenge page")

3. Located the Sigma rule file:
 ```
C:\Users\LetsDefend\Desktop\ChallengeFile\proc_creation_win_bitsadmin_download.yml
```

3. Analyzed the Sigma rule sections:

- Selection: defined suspicious process creation patterns involving bitsadmin.exe.

- Condition: combined selections to flag malicious usage.

- Tags & Fields: identified the ruleâ€™s focus on ransomware and C2 communications.

- Logsource: Windows process creation events.

4. Mapped how this rule would detect attempts by ransomware to use bitsadmin.exe for downloads.

5. Documented findings and uploaded screenshots for reference.

Explored the Lab Environment provided by LetsDefend

I used the Timeline Explorer for my findings

I discovered that the targeted executable file was the one targeted by the Sigma rule

The command line option used to indicate the file transfer in the Sigma rule

The logical expression in the condition field combined the criteria to trigger the Sigma rule

The specific field the Sigma rule captured shows the command being executed
