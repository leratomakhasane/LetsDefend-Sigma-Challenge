# LetsDefend-Sigma-Challenge
Detection engineering practice: Write-up and analysis of a LetsDefend challenge using a Sigma rule to detect ransomware activity leveraging bitsadmin.exe.
<br>
<br>
## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Detect and analyze a ransomware infection that leveraged the Windows utility bitsadmin.exe to download additional malicious payloads, using a Sigma detection rule.
<br>
## ðŸ§  Skills Learned

- Understanding Sigma rules and their structure (selection, condition, tags, fields, log sources)

- Investigating ransomware behaviour with built-in Windows utilities

- Correlating malicious activity with command-and-control (C2) communication patterns

- Applying detection engineering concepts in a real-world SOC scenario
<br>

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- LetsDefend Platform (challenge environment)

- Sigma Rules (YAML format)

- Windows Event Logs (proc_creation events)

- Text Editor (to review .yml rule file)

<br>

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed

1. Reviewed the challenge description: ransomware suspected of using bitsadmin.exe.
   ![The LetsDefend Challenge page explaining what the challenge is about](sigma-challenge-description.png "LetsDefend Learn Sigma Challenge page")

3. Located the Sigma rule file:
 ```
C:\Users\LetsDefend\Desktop\ChallengeFile\proc_creation_win_bitsadmin_download.yml
```

3. Analyzed the Sigma rule sections:

- Selection: defined suspicious process creation patterns involving bitsadmin.exe.

- Condition: combined selections to flag malicious usage.

- Tags & Fields: identified the ruleâ€™s focus on ransomware and C2 communications.

- Logsource: Windows process creation events.

4. Mapped how this rule would detect attempts by ransomware to use bitsadmin.exe for downloads.

5. Documented findings and uploaded screenshots for reference.
